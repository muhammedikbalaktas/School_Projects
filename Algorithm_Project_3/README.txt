README File: Running the Half TSP Code

This README file provides instructions on how to run the code for solving the Half Traveling Salesperson Problem (Half TSP). The code is implemented in Python and aims to find a tour that visits half of the given cities while minimizing the total distance traveled.
Prerequisites


Running the Code

Follow these steps to run the Half TSP code:
    Inside main.py there is <<input_file = 'input-3'>> line in order to change the input file please change inside code and please do not add ".txt" in code it is already added.
    The input file should be at the same directory with "main.py" file.
    Open a command prompt or terminal: Navigate to the directory where you saved the "main.py" file.

    Run the code: In the command prompt or terminal, execute the following command to run the code:

    bash

    python main.py

    The code will read the input file, solve the Half TSP problem, and generate an output file named "output.txt" in the same directory.
